# Getting Started

## Access Information

You will perform all lab tasks on a Linux virtual machine provisioned for this environment.

### SSH Connection

Use the following command to connect to the virtual machine:

```bash
ssh <inject key="VMUserName" enableCopy="true"/>@<inject key="VMPublicDNSName" enableCopy="true"/>
```

### Username

```text
<inject key="VMUserName" enableCopy="true"/>
```

### Password

```text
<inject key="VMPassword" enableCopy="true"/>
```

## Note

If you prefer not to use a browser-based terminal, you may connect to the virtual machine directly from your local computer using any SSH client, including:

* OpenSSH (Linux/macOS)
* Windows Terminal or PowerShell
* PuTTY
* MobaXterm
* Termius

Use the SSH command and credentials provided above to establish the connection.

> **Important:** Ensure that your local network allows outbound SSH connections on port 22 before attempting to connect from your local machine.

## Verification

After connecting successfully, verify access by running:

```bash
whoami
hostname
```

The commands should display your current username and the hostname of the lab virtual machine.
